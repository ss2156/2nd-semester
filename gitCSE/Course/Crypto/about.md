Tentative syllabus: (May not be followed exactly as mentioned below. The syllabus is meant to be a rough guideline only. I plan to cover 4 types of topics in the course which are organized in different bullet points below.)

    Foundations: Attacking Toy ciphers, Kerckhoffâ€™s law, Perfect security, OWF, PRG, PRF, PRP.
    Symmetric key cryptography: Block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, MAC,
    authenticated encryption. 
    Asymmetric Key cryptography: DKHE, RSA, El Gamal cryptosystems (with required
    mathematical foundations), Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Digital signatures, Public Key Infrastructure and
    Digital certificates. 
    Cryptographic protocols: Secure multiparty computation, Zero knowledge proofs, Oblivious
    transfer. + Any other advanced topics.

Grading scheme:
Relative grading which will be uniform for the class (i.e. no difference for BTech, MTech, or PhD students). 

Weightage of different components: (if there is any change in the scheme below, it will be announced in the class and posted on this Google classroom).

    Minor-1: 15 %
    Minor-2: 15 %
    Major: 25 %
    Assignments: 25%
    Project: 20% (Multiple evaluations will take place, not just a final report submission)


    Welcome to the wonderland of Cryptography. I hope you enjoy studying this course as much as I enjoy teaching it. :-)

General information:This is a first course on Cryptography and hence will be self-contained. I will cover whatever mathematical background is needed in the course. However, liking for theoretical CS style proofs (e.g. typically done in an algorithms course) and Mathematics (e.g. a course like discrete mathematics, or abstract algebra) will be needed. Secondly, the course will have a project component which will require some effort. Hence, do not take this course if you expect an easy life. At the same time, I promise that you will love the course if you continue it with seriousness till the end of the semester. As one student commented to me last year about the same course she did with me two years ago, "It was a fantastic course, and many of the things which can be done with Cryptography looked like magic." 

A general advice is to engage in discussion in the classes. Do not let the classes be a one-way flow of information. Let there be lots of questions and clarifications. If there is not enough time in the class for somethings then use this Google classroom for discussions. I absolutely encourage all course related discussion on this group. You can post questions, reply to questions posed your colleagues, and/or post any relevant information/news/... related to the subject. If a question remains unanswered then I will respond.  

Suggested books/notes for the course: (I will try to follow the first one to a large extent. This may be treated as the main textbook):

In addition, there are fantastic lecture notes by (i) Shafi Goldwasser & Mihir Bellare, (ii) Luca Trevisan, (iii) Rafael Pass & abhi Shelat, and many others. And there is an excellent free video course by Prof. Dan Boneh on coursera which covers a part of the syllabus.
