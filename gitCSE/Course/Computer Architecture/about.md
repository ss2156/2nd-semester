## High level Goals
- understand the principles
- understand the precendents
- how to use above two for new designs

### Day1 05/01/24
- introduction by teacher about himself.
- introduction of students: * Name, Place of belonging, Why chose to do Mtech :) *
- made aware of grading scheme and Goals and Objectives of the course.
- Discussed why to study computer architecture or why this course.
  As we are computer programmers(funny) we like only to code or try to make application then why should we worry about the underlying architecture of system.
  we were shown the stack of layer to solve any computer or digital problem
  | stack |
  | ----- |
  | Problem |
  | Algorithm |
  | Code |
  | Instruction Set |
  | Architecture |
  | Microarchitecture |
  | Logic |
  | Circuit |
  | Electron |
  
  All steps of code compilation were discussed: .c->|preprocessor|->.i->|compiler|->.asm->|assembler|->.obj(object code)->machine code(.out)
  
  Is the architecture of system frequently changes or is it a long term solution: it was answered by taking above stack and given example of still used x86 and x64 architecture.
  
### Day2 08/01/24

### Day3 10/01/24

### Day4 15/01/24
- Recursive or Iterative version of program
- Single core of high frequency or Many core of lower frequency
- Moore's Law
- Why we moved to incresing in no of chores after 2005
- what is GPU & ASICS
- How come ASICS are used in different ML algo if it is made or usable for a partcular function or algo
